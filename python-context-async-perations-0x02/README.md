# Advanced Python: Generators, Decorators, Context Managers, and Asynchronous Programming

## Objective
To deepen Python programming knowledge by exploring advanced techniques, including generators, context managers, and asynchronous programming. These concepts allows one to write more efficient, readable, and maintainable code, particularly in scenarios involving large data processing, resource management, and concurrent execution.

## Key Concepts covered:
- **Generators:** creating iterators with generators
- **Decorators:* Modifying function methods with decorators
- Managing resources with context managers
- Implementing async functions and coroutines
